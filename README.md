I gave a talk at Edlambda a few years ago about how much I love Edinburgh LCF. I wrote a demo in Haskell as a side-effect, but was too lazy to think about the consequences of infinite propositions (Haw!)

I'm going to document and complete this as literate Haskell, inspired by John Harrison's brilliant approach to teaching formal logic via working code in the Handbook of Practical Logic.

For now, the only literate file is Propositional.lhs

I'm still not happy with that first file. It needs to be a better tutorial. :/
